Restreamer [liquidsoap version]
===============================

This little script is a liquidsoap script to restream and/or re-encode a stream.
At the moment, the configuration is not made to be used generally since I made
it especially to restream r/a/dio on my server. Don't be surprised if you don't
understand how the configuration works.

Also, I made this script for an r/a/dio relay.

Requirements
============

- Liquidsoap >= 1.0
- Liquidsoap LADSPA support & vLevel plugin
- Liquidsoap AAC+ encoding support
- Liquidsoap OPUS encoding support
